You're a big thinker who prefers to have adventures of the mind instead of exploring the real world. An expert at taking care of life's necessities, you're unlikely to go out on a limb for something you don't really need. After your friends do wild, impossible things, you invite them to your house so they can tell you all about it. Your best romantic match is someone a little timid who hangs on your every word. A bolder or more independent lover would probably make you crazy."
